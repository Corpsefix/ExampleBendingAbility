For Daddy Bruce
Well i did this in 10 minutes because im really busy with school and work right now, if u want me to ask about the methods i used please do so.
Its about an small, slow ability which does a lot of damage in close range. i need to check for obsidianblocks, to throw them, but i didnt had anymore time to do that. Next Week ill have more time.
